- Documentation on how I use Git
## Basics
To make changes:
```
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
git commit -m "your commit message"
```
To push that to the central server (which makes it available for deployment):
```
git push
```
To revert a file to it's state in the repository:
```
git checkout path/to/file_that_has_changed
```
To get the latest code changes:
```
git pull --rebase
```

## Remote Branches: Your Own
We use remote tracking branches for branching.
To create a tracking branch called "ajax_fallback":
```
git checkout -b ajax_fallback
git push -u origin ajax_fallback
```
To push changes in this branch:
```
git push
```
If you get an error, pull the latest files, then try again:
```
git pull
git push
```
If, after that, you still get an error for `git push`, pull on master, then go 
back to the branch and try again:
```
git checkout master
git pull --rebase
```
- Try again.
```
git checkout ajax_fallback
git push
```
If, after that, you still get an error and the error message contains `[rejected]`,
then find the branch name next to `[rejected]` and update it. Then go back 
and try again:
```
git checkout branch_that_was_rejected
git pull
```
- Try again.
```
git checkout ajax_fallback
git push
```
To pull changes that other people have made to this branch (do not use rebase!):
```
git pull
```
To pull changes that have been made to the master (do not use rebase!):
```
git merge master
git push
```
If you get an error for `git push`, do a straight `git pull` without `--rebase`.
```
git pull
```
To see the full diff of what's changed in this branch:
```
git checkout master
git diff master ajax_fallback
```
When you are ready to merge the branch back into master:
- Double check the full diff of what changed.
```
git checkout master
git diff master ajax_fallback
```
- Merge it (keep in mind you are still in master).
```
git merge ajax_fallback
git push
```
- Delete the local and remote branches.
```
git branch -d ajax_fallback
git push origin :ajax_fallback
```

## Remote Branches: Other People's
To check out the branch somebody else has created:
```
git checkout --track origin/ajax_fallback
```
To push changes in this branch:
```
git push
```
To pull changes that other people have made to this branch (do not use rebase!):
```
git pull
```
To pull changes that have been made to master (do not use rebase!):
```
git merge master
git push
```
To see the full diff of what's changed in this branch:
```
git checkout master
git diff master ajax_fallback
```

git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. git fetch is used in conjunction with git remote, git branch, git checkout, and git reset to update a local repository to the state of a remote. 
```
git fetch
```

## Local Branches
Generally all of our branches are remote, but if you want to create a local one,
a few things are different -- namely to use `git rebase master` when you 
pull chnages from master.
To create the branch:
```
git checkout -b ajax_fallback
```
To pull changes that have been made to the master:
```
git rebase master
```


## Viewing Info
To view which branch you are on:
```
git status
```
To view all branches, including remotes:
```
git branch -a
```
To view all branches, with information about whether they're tracking/remotes:
```
git remote show again
```
